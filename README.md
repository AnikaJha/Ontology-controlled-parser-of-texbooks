Short Description of Subject Field:

The programming model is based on Python programming language using JSON techniques, Natasha parcer instruments, and some other instruments, so that the model should be able to read the texts of training tasks, identify relationships between subjects in the presence of defaults, and solve physical problems using specified algorithms.
